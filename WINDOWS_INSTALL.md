## Troubleshooting

### Error: "This app package's publisher certificate could not be verified" (0x800B010A)

This error means the certificate is not trusted. Use the **method** above to install the certificate.

### Error: "This script must be run as Administrator"

Right-click PowerShell and select **"Run as Administrator"** before running the script.

### Error: "Execution of scripts is disabled on this system"

Run this command in PowerShell (as Administrator):
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Why is this needed?

Spartan Wallet is signed with a self-signed certificate for development releases. Windows requires either:
- Installing the certificate to your trusted store, or
- Enabling Developer Mode

For production releases, we plan to use a trusted code signing certificate to eliminate this step.
